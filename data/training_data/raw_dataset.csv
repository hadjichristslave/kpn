When I checked my bank statement, I found they charged me twice, so I called the bank and cancelled one of the transactions and forgot about it. Later in June, I tried to use my Rebtel account to send funds to Cuba again, and my account was ""restricted"". I contacted Rebtel and the response I received was that they restricted my account because of my claim for the duplicated transaction and basically the only way for them to restore my account was if I told my bank I was wrong with the claim in first place. We went back and forth a couple of emails and they insisted with the pretension that I had to cancel my claim with the bank (by the way, we are talking about $20 here).Of course, I am not going to do it because it wasn't my fault that their software didn't process it in first place, but did process the transaction after.In my opinion, that is not the best way to handle a situation like this with a long term client. As a result, I am using a different provider now.        ",1 star: Bad

Because of that I spent in 2 calls what I usually spend in a month.I just want to have all the money charged incorrectly returned and see this issue fixed. Rebtel is trying to put the fault in my Internet provider but no chance as my bills from them are correct. This is very annoying, I'm a person that like to be fair to everyone but rebtel is not being fair and is showing a very bad customer service.

150,/reviews/5ce47c07a843690ac8c25205,An absolute nightmare. Ignorance of law and the worst customer service imaginable,"            Short version:1. Rebtel can randomly lock up your account blaming VPN, which I believe is untrue as I have been using VPN every day for the past 1.5 years simultaneously with Rebtel. 2. When you get locked up, wave good bye to the money you spent on your subscription and do not expect any refunds. 3. Instead of a refund, expect they will just auto-renew your subscription and charge you for a new month because you won't be able to access your account to cancel the subscription. 4. Once you contact their customer services, be ready for an example of utterly miserable, inefficient customer services definitely not focussed on resolving issues or providing at least tolerable level of customer care. Expect poor response times beyond industry standards, customer services chronologically responding old emails without reviewing your latest emails. 5. Expect chaos and lack of compliance with legislation such as GDPR. Expect to be contacted via email addresses not linked to the email you used to register on Rebtel - potentially putting your account and data at riskDetailed version:I have used Rebtel for years and have dealt with their customer services on a number of occasions. Overall, it has always been slow and dreadful process to resolve any issue. I used to love Rebtel because it was the only company that actually really worked in terms of quality of calls and all that at reasonable prices. I have never really cared about Rebtel's technical issues (and I have experienced quite a few over the time) but rather the miserable, unprofessional, slow and unhelpful service they provided whenever I needed a help with any issue. Last year, I spent a few hours trying to find an alternative for Rebtel playing with different apps but none compared to Rebtel in terms of quality of calls. I carried on. Having been using VPN on a daily basis for a year and half, all of a sudden they blocked my account and started to request unreasonable amount and detail of information - when answered they would come up with a new set of ridiculous questions. I have done a few security verifications say with financial services companies and none was as bad as the one of Rebtel. Rebtel's security verification process is chaotic, non-systemic, random, unreasonable. I accidentally used my other email account for one of the emails I sent to them and I was politely informed they cannot reply emails that are coming from email addresses not linked to the email I used for my account registration, yet they would later contact me using that email account - chaotic and GDPR non-compliant. During the time I couldn't access my account I couldn't use my subscription minutes - yet they would reject my refund request. As I couldn't access my account to cancel the subscription instead of actually refunding me, they would charge me for another 30 days worth of their fantastic services. I requested my account to be closed and data wiped yet they would ignore my email and just reply some email I sent earlier completely disregarding what I requested. Rebtel's response time is way beyond industry standards, and their approach to dealing with queries chronologically is unprofessional and inefficient. Rebtel either clearly never heard about companies measuring response times and rate of customers whose query is resolved in one email or are really bad at managing these metrics. Rebtel will make you want to forget about the brand and business you once loved.I have raised an official complaint with Rebtel and I am ready to protect my rights through escalation of my case to the authorities in charge of GDPR enforcement and fair trading such as Ombudsmans should Rebtel continue to further ignore my complaint or should they fail to resolve it. i will edit my Trustpilot with further details.Edit #1: I had requested a refund and an account closure, but I received a response from Rebtel and world credits, which is basically the opposite of what I want - to get my money back and have my account closed.

I assume that messages are not read or maybe there is a lack of language knowledge. Recently, I figured out by myself that Austria was eliminated from the subscription. My question was simple ""What has happened with my subscription?"" and I received a lousy response. I was told that I did not make a payment that was not true. My subscription is automatically deducted from my credit card. In fact, Rebtel has eliminated Austria, Portugal, etc. from the subscription WITHOUT any notification that this will happen. This is very disappointing and I expect from an apparently professional provider a way much better support. Just copy and pasting any responding that does not make sense upset customers. More, customers will look for other companies. Makes sense?        ",2 stars: Poor

It would be nice if the app didn't provide a dialer but used the native dialer in the relevant OS. It would also be nice to offer a pinless dialing number so you could configure pauses with native dialer. The interfaces in both web/mobile are easy to navigate, however, the app does not provide the ability to configure local numbers. Finally, the iOS experience can be confusing as some apps have a cost and the main one does not. Room to improve but overall a good offering.        ",4 stars: Great

Regardless of the time difference with the rest of the world REBTEL in Sweden and/or Luxembourg has to find the way to offer a real customer service, where customers can talk to you.

831,/reviews/5b721f1c14b7d8043c8e9d0f,Rebtel is a relatively good service,"            Rebtel is a relatively good service, with some problems.  Customer service is generally good, but not always consistent.  Sometimes it can be very frustrating, but I think people who actually pay for their call (like me) would care more versus someone who use the free calling feature.       Calls do have connection problems from time to time, which can be a problem if you are calling about something important.      The monthly subscription plan for calling to specific country can be frustrating because the minutes do not rollover and the renewal is every 30 days (meaning you have to keep track of 30 days, there is no set day for renewal). This means the plan will not renew on the 13th of every month, but varies based on thirty days from your initial subscription - so next month could be on the 11th instead of the 13th and you will lose all minutes you did not use.     Customer service is usually good about reimbursement for dropped calls and other connection problems, but they have this ridiculous policy of only reimbursing for calls under a minute or some brief time like that.  If you have connection problems in the middle of a longer call, you are going to have a tough time getting then to address the problem. This is a big problem when I call to Asia, the first few minutes could be good, but sound quality may start deteriorating thirty minutes in or the call could suddenly end.        ",4 stars: Great

There are two problems using this app with android.  When I have the settings set to route international calls through Rebtel,  I dial the international number through the native dialer and  about 5% or 10% of the time the app fails to activate and the call goes through my usual phone provider, resulting in HORRIFIC  charges.  I realize my mobile providers charges are not Rebtela fault, but the failure of the call to route through Rebtel Is their fault.  The app needed to work reliably and predictably.  The other problem is that sometimes the app picks up the international call (which is good) but their system fails to recognize my number (the caller id might not be giving Rebtel the right number to associate the account to). Rebtel needs to figure out how to associate they phone with the account when caller Id on the phone fails.  Other than those two failures I can't fault the service        ",4 stars: Great

Make a call using Rebtel app, once the called party responds, its timer begins to roll. Exactly at that instant start a timer on the other smartphone.

The charge amounted to $ 22.05, making this call almost $0.50/minute!

Therefore, I called my bank to dispute the transaction. When I complained to Rebtel, they ‚Äúrestricted‚Äù my account and demanded that I cancel the dispute and accept the (unauthorized) charge. Really? The bottom line is I will no longer use their services. There are so many free alternatives: WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook Messenger, Googlechat and so on and so forth. I‚Äôm hoping they give me a refund for any unused minutes. Unfortunately, I cannot check to see if I have unused minutes because they have blocked my account. What a way to approach customer service!! Just shut the customer up?! Ridiculous. First I got a message from Rebtel agreeing to the refund of $7.90. Then I got the following message (which is an exact copy of theirs): ‚ÄúYour account was locked due to a payment dispute. The payment you made with your Visa ending on - - - - on 2018-01-26 20:37:37 is currently under dispute, which means that you or the cardholder reported the payment as unauthorized.A common cause for reversed payments is insufficient funds or payment fraud so the locking of the account is measured we take to protect the owner of the Used credit card.To unlock your Rebtel account, we kindly suggest you cancel these disputes and please also provide us with a written confirmation of your bank of the canceled disputes and saying that you recognize that payment and accept the charge.‚ÄùUPDATE: Below is Rebtel‚Äôs response to my request for reimbursement for unused minutes.

As local calls are free with our provider Rebtel is perfect for us. We pay 5 Dollars a month, can add unlimited Swiss phone numbers (landlines and cell phone numbers) and talk for free. On our end we dial always the same local number assigned to the Swiss number, so it can be saved on the phone. My family and friends still see our normal number displayed on their phone and call us on our normal number. Rebtel doesn't change anything on our end. I installed the Rebtel app on my smartphone too and it works great as long as I am having cell service. VoIP with the cell didn't work well, but as I mentioned, our internet comes over a satellite.        ",5 stars: Excellent

I was absolutely wrong to trust that statement.My phone is not working since 24-Oct-17. I have written to them like every second day but of no use. No replies. No follow up and unfortunately for Rebtel I had to come here to give my negative rating. No one is bothered at all in this company to communicate with customer. After I reported the problem Rebtel wrote to me only once sending me questionnaire and I replied on all those questions and after that there was no reply at all even though I wrote to them when it would start working again? I think probably Rebtel could not solve it. Rebtel withdrew the money from my account and within couple of days all the local numbers stopped working. I would request Rebtel please put the money back to my account and stop to cheat the people who trust you.Thank you !That's my ticket number - 1317999‚Äç , If you cant do anything please put the money back to my account.What a shameful behaviour from you Rebtel and Tatiana. you asked me the ticket number and then again no communication at all.

Rebtel will automatically block your account if you are using any type of VPN or IP address changer, which is not against of any regulation or agreement between service provider and client. They will claim is for security measures but the truth is that they sell your browsing history, your calls patterns and location, the frequency, in brief, they profit your online activity like any other crock site claiming they are protecting your account by default violating your privacy rights.To corroborate this, I bet I will receive a faster response from Rebtel team apologizing on this platform than them actually contacting me for the claim I still waiting for on the Rebtel website.Spanish:La clasificacion mas baja que esta plataforma  permite es una estrella, pero Rebtel no merece realmente ninguna.

For others:Following up on my 1star (if I could I'd give no star) review, seeing that Rebtel Custome Service responds to 'public' reviews on sites like these, rather than through their customer support line.First to my issue for contacting them (FAKE unlimited calling!!!). I can see why some people on Trustpilot think their customer service is a machine responding and not a real person. I clearly stated that my UNLIMITED CALLING plan says  'UNITED STATES UNLIMITED': call ANY NUMBER in  the United States AS MUCH AS YOU WANT, both landline and mobile' and even sent them a screen shot of that!!!! But they just send the same answer over and over again. HEY REBTEL IF YOU DON'T KNOW ENGLISH DON'T USE IT!!! U N L I M I T E D MEANS NO that's - NO RESTRICTIONS -!!!!. If you're as sophisticated a service as you claim to be - newsflash - it's 2 0 1 7 find a way to weed out your commercial scammers with  2 0 1 7 technology. Second: I've taken the time to read reviews - or rather mostly 1 star ratings - about Rebtel on this site. SAME COMPLAINTS OVER AND OVER GOING SEVERAL YEARS BACK!!!! A N D SAME INCOMPETENT ANSWERS OVER AND OVER!!!!They clearly have several disclosure issues but on their website they claim'Legal informationHere at Rebtel we‚Äôre committed to managing our business in a transparent and ethical way. We promise to always be upfront with our customers about how our business works (and especially what it costs)'. In 2013 Rebtel reported revenue of $95 million (source: Wikipedia), which can't be that hard to reach if you don't disclose to your customers...I won't go into even more details - AS IT IS THEIR JOB NOT MINE to read customer reviews and MAKE CHANGES ACCORDINGLY. From the time I've spent reading complaints there are SEVERAL ISSUES (that KEEP COMING UP!!) THEY SHOULD ADDRESS, to retain customers and their satisfaction.Rebtel should also keep in mind - that for every customer that takes the time and effort to file a complaint - there is a huge percentage out there that doesn't and just leaves and let's all their friends know HOW BAD REBTEL IS!! I very rarely write reviews and my last one here was approx. 2013 - and it was positve (and waaayyyy shorter).To sum up Rebtel1) They don't disclose properly on several issues2) When contacted -if they answer- it is inadequate, bordering on stupid3) They are more likely to respond if you give them a bad review on a 'public' site (although they quite often claim they can't find your info, tix#, etc.)4) The issues are not likely to get resolved (see also  point 2 above)5) Conclusion -> why stay with Rebtel, when they don't provide what they say they do, don't seem to care about their customer's satisfaction and DON'T FIX THE PROBLEMS THEY CAUSE!!6) It's 2017 there are plenty other providers out there.... ======================================================My original review:NO unlimited calling - as their deal said! BAD customer service!I have the same problems as many other reviewers. I bought the unlimited calling to the USA which reads 'United States Unlimited, call any number in the United States as much as you want, both landline and mobile'.However, yesterday I tried to make a call and got a message that I could only call 30 unique numbers during my billing period, and that unlimited was not for commercial calling!?I emailed support and heard back- basically the same thing I got from the phone message when I tried to make the call the night before. I replied, that I am making private calls, but that I'm abroad right now and need to stay in touch w/ people for important things, including the hurricanes that are currently ravaging.I also included a screen shot of my 'so called unlimited deal!'. Still haven't heard back!!I appreciate that they want keep commercial callers out - but they have to come up w/ something much better than just cutting off customers unexpectedly.I've started to look around for other services -even though I've been w/ Rebtel for many years.

I emailed the ""help"" at Rebtel and I got a reply which was basically saying that they can't refund my world credit and they are basically using whichever credit with the closest valid date (I honestly didn't really understand it, but I let it go). The next day when my 1 week free trial is up, I paid the $10 monthly subscription for Indonesia Unlimited (6/29/2017) and I can also see that my world credit balance has kept going down as I made calls to Indonesia (which I thought it was supposed to be covered by the monthly subscription). Today (7/7/17) with ACTIVE Indonesia unlimited account (renewed in 23 days) and $6.14 in my World Credits - I placed a call to Indonesia and guess what? I got this message again: ""Your account balance is too low..."" Uuumm...can anyone give me a reasonable explanation for this please?!

Your customers should know about this limitation upfront and you need to tell them how many numbers they have used and how many they have left.

They keep using this call dropping technique so that I use less minutes, it's shameless and stupid company who has no understanding about the customer service.  Updated review as at 30/06/17:- Further to my review on 17/06/17, I hereby provide some new updates regarding the service i have been receiving from fraudulent co. Just to make it clear, I have took a subscription for an unlimited calls to Bangladesh for a monthly 9.99 pounds which Rebtel increased to 24.99 because they said I am using too many minutes (well thats why i have an unlimited subscription). Anyhow, I still carried on with the subscription despite their awful call quality and customer service.However, since 28/06/17, I could no longer make a call to bangladesh and they have blocked a number that I call!  When enquired, after complaining several times, they bombarded me with their robotic message, finally Mark Louie from customer service said,'Hello Mr..Tanks for contacting and patience in reaching us! The number has been flagged due to an abnormal use far above what is determined, as normal use, by our system! Calls to that number will be resumed in 7 days. Thanks for understanding!'- Now, I pay for an unlimited phone calls, mainly to one person. I pay a premium for this service 24.99/month. It's not Rebtel to determine how many mins I speak when I have an unlimited subscription for a very premium charge!- I would have stopped using service of this crook but I think these corporate thugs getting away with these malpractices with many other customer. So my mission is to push these criminals out of the telecommunication market!Updated review as at 17/06/17:-Further to my earlier review, I intent to provide some further update regarding the awful service Rebtel provide. I will shed lights on the call quality, call drops and feedback/help  I have received from Rebtel when complained about the service. -I used to have a subscription for unlimited calls to Bangladesh, however, Rebtel increased the monthly subscription from ¬£9.99 to ¬£20.99 when I provided negative review about the co and its awful service. - Despite the increase in monthly charge, I still use Rebtel, however every ten/fifteen minutes my calls are dropped, when I complain, they email me a robotic message which goes on to say ""Hi MR, My name is Sophie and I work with customer satisfaction at Rebtel. I noticed that you just rated your last call with 1 out of 5 stars on its quality. Something didn't work for you and I want to understand why. Not only because I want to fix any technical issues straight away, but more importantly because offering you the best call quality is my number 1 priority. So, help me understand what went wrong: Were you calling from home or on the go?Does it only happen when you call that specific number?If this was the first time the problem happened, what was different this time?I really want to solve the problem so anything you can tell me is a HUGE help and I really appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time :) /Sophie""Once you provide the info. nothing else happens!

Please DON'T GIVE A PENNY TO THIS FAKE COMPANY.Each time I report that I cannot make a call , I get an automated message saying ""please provide details of your call""once I provide the details I get no more reply. I have an unlimited account with Rebtel to call Bangladesh but I couldn't make any calls in the last two days. When I kept reporting the issues I no longer get a reply even.

Because I lodged complaints from mobile there is no ticket number. However I am sure Rebtel can check how many I begged them to sort out my connection, AWFUL COMPANY, YOU SHOULD BE SHAMED FOR YOUR SERVICE !Updated on 23/05/17: Rebtel have deactivated my subscription after writing this review.

I talked to an agent and he was rude and absurd. I even told him how important it was for me to make a call to India. He was totally helpless and I don't even think how to treat customers. He didn't even what I was talking about! When I thought he is not helping me out, I rated him 1 star and ended the conversation. He came back to me saying I was rude for giving him 1 star and that he was thinking of giving me some credit.

When you call this local number that Rebtel gave you (you can only call it from your own number that you register with), Rebtel will connect you with an international number you wish to call.Like I said, first you need to register (enter it to Rebtel system via web interface) your own number (from wich you will be calling) and also that international number that you wish to call.Everything went well and everything was O.K. for first 100 minutes, which they charged me per minute at their calling rate price. Then Rebtel start to make this harassments and demands to tell them what is this number that I am calling (it was just one Estonian mobile number), to whom this number belongs, and why am I calling just and only this number (?!).Also they suspended my account (I can not make calls anymore, although I still have valid balance, and I paid for this service upfront), telling me that it is for my own protection. I do not understand why, as I registered all numbers in their system, and I paid for this service, therefor, I should call whoever I want. But Rebtel thinks that I should explain to them why am I calling this number, and who is the owner of this Estonian mobile number that I was calling! Outrageous!Also, I recomended several of my friends (because until now I was really satisfied with the quality of their service and price), and one of them got suspended also!When they suspend you, you got an automatic e-mail telling you that you are suspended, and you can not login, or make new calls even if you have balance and you paid for this service upfront. You have to write them and ask why they suspended you and why you can not use this service that you paid for, then you have to wait for their answer, and then this harrassment started.I believe that I did not done anything wrong, I registered and paid for this service, I was calling Estonian mobile number and they charged me per minute at their calling rate price. But, as I said, after 100 minutes they suspended my account and started to harassment me with these questions and asked me to provide them with some informations that was not their concern.I paid for the service, they charged me, and therefore, I should call whoever I want, even this is one Estonian number, without explaining myself to anyone. I did not done anything wrong. But no, they suspended my account and they started to harassment me.My friend has also the same problem. We selected Rebtel as they have the most affordable calling rates for Estonia, and they provided you with local number to call.

Also the improvement they made in the app is great as I don't have to call a special number to have my calls connected. I call a lot and in fact use 600 minutes to call Nigeria  in less than a week but its so worth it because the call quality is super good, there are few glitches sometimes though but for an international call its not too bad. Also the call connects even if the other party's phone is switched off this is very bad And am taking a star out for that. It made me think my fianc√©e was quarrelling with me and won't pick up her phone whereas her phone was completely off because she couldn't charge he phone. Also my credit got deducted for those dials about 20min plus because I continued dialing and each dial lasted 2 mins each which really made me mad. well am over it now. Let's continue with the review: an improvement I will like is for them to make the app recognizable as a calling app so that I can just connect without  going to the rebtel app every time.

I have allowed a week for Rebtel customer service to respond, during which period I made two attempts to get assistance.  The new problem: I have not been able to get any calls through. My contacts tell me that they have received no calls from me whatsoever. Meanwhile, Rebtel has been charging me for the time I spend on the line, while waiting - not talking. The complete unresponsiveness on the side of the customer service has convinced me I will stop using Rebtel after I run down my credit. Old update: after back-and-forth messages with the customer service - I should point out that they assigned a different agent per email - I have received a compensation. Mind you, this only came about after days of having to explain and pressurizing their customer service agents.When you order a $10 meal off of a menu in a restaurant, how much do you expect to pay for it when you ask for the bill? In normal state of affairs,  you'd pay the price listed in the menu. But the same logic does not apply to Rebtel's service, which I found out through a first-hand experience. I come from Uzbekistan, and was pleased to learn that I could stay in touch with my family as Rebtel seemingly offered a very attractive rate to call numbers in the country: 0.023 EUR per minute. However, after a few calls it came to my attention that I was running out of credit way too quickly. Upon reviewing my activity log, I was disturbed to learn that the company had charged me between 0.23 to 1.34 EUR per minute on different calls to the exact same numbers. That is 10 and 58 times the rate which is indicated on the app - 0.023 EUR/min - which also conveniently shows up before I made the each call.  I quote from the customer service response to my inquiry regarding this matter: ""I can assure you that we wanted to keep the same rates, but we were forced to increase them due to capacity issues and to be able to sustain the same level of quality.""Going back to the restaurant comparison: in a similar scenario to the one I am experiencing with Rebtel, you'd be paying anywhere between $100 to $580 for the $10 meal you had ordered. And you would find that out only after you had eaten the damn food. The server would kindly inform you that ""due to capacity issues"" the meal you just ate got much more expensive now - so deal with it. No restaurant would be allowed to continue conducting business in this fraudulent manner, and neither should any company. Avoid this service if you do not feel like dealing with multiple customer service agents just to get your money back.        ",1 star: Bad

I have been a customer with Rebtel for 6 years and never had cause to worry till April, 23rd 2010. They took money from my account (supposedly my monthly subscription charge) without an email or adding minutes to my account. I had a monthly subscription and it was all going well. I would get an email immediately it's gone through and also have the minutes loaded into my Rebtel account.My bank on the other hand has never alerted me of a fraud purchase but for this purchase they did. First thing I did before confirming it was a fraud was to check my inbox for an email and also my Rebtel account for the minutes purchased but to my bewilderment, there was no email sent, neither was there $15 worth minutes added to my account so I responded a ""no"" to my bank. It was a type yes or no answer if you recognize that purchase and an email or the purchased minutes in question, I didn't recognize that purchase.Rebtel went ahead to restrict my access to my account. I have not been able to use the $9 worth of minutes I already had in my account for almost two weeks.They clearly showed great detest stating that I should have notified them first before notifying my bank. I went to great lengths explaining to them that - this had never happened, - I didn't go to my bank, they reached out to me - I waited for hours to receive their email to confirm the payment,- I also asked them to check their records and see that I never got an email confirmation of my payment as is always the case.- I also said my minutes weren't added. They sent me emails insisting it was there. I have sent over 6 emails to them explaining but they have told me they will not give me access to my account unless I call my bank and admit the charge, get them to provide a written letter stating it was not a fraud and sent the letter to me. My entire friends and family who have also been in Rebtel for over 7 years are shocked.I have never been backmailed in my life and to think that I would betray my person considering also the services my bank provides me in protecting my account is just beyond me.Rebtel is basically punishing me for refusing to be blackmailed. After over 6 years of being on this service why would I jump up to create a dispute if they were no grounds? It was a clear fraud and I feel bad I have recommended them to all my family and friends in US and the UK? And for $15?

This matter  should be reported to consumer protection authorities this absolutely ilegal to act in the way they does. They should be sued for breaching consumer rights. My advice is  shop around for better service. THANKS        ",1 star: Bad

I had used it Rebtel for at least 3 years now, successfully only to wake up to the worst case scenario and an even worse customer service platform. They posted on their Facebook page that they couldn't connect calls. Of course I haven't even opened my own Facebook profile in years, how would I know, so I make calls unknowingly that Rebtel is not working. Mind you, voice system says everything it says on any other normal day, ""Welcome to Rebel please enter the international number you want to call'"" etc. So I call, I have topped up my account with about 500 minutes so I'm not even worried. I make my usual calls, to all my relatives, friends unknowingly. The next day I find out that instead of charging my Rebtel account as was supposed to happen all the calls (now I know it was due to their connectivity issues) of course AT&T picked them all up and now I had a $400 bill. After five days of trying to contact them, I wind up having to contact them through Facebook, and they end up saying oh we don't see any of your calls on our logs, well of course if your system was actually down you aren't going to see anything. Then they say we'll give you $20 credit as a sign of good faith. $400, $20 , good faith? Come on now. And then they try hide behind the issue of not interfering with third parties, no this is about how your system fooled me. At this point it's not even about just the bill, the emotional toll all this has taken on me is included.

2330,/reviews/56e3858e0000ff000944efc8,Dropped calls to Cuba,"            I downloaded Rebtel on my iPhone to call my boyfriend in Cuba. To be fair for the last three years I have been using google voice and Cuballama both of which have dropped calls, and sometimes it's almost impossible to hear eachother - as seems to be the case for most Cuban communications. I had high hopes having read the reviews on using Rebtel to call Cuba and getting crystal clear connections. So far: most of the time when I call it doesn't even ring on his end, and it eventually (1.5 min or more of ringing) it takes me to a message from Verizon (my carrier) saying the call couldn't be completed. Once in a while it connects perfectly and I can hear him very well - the best so far. He can not hear me as well, one time he got clear reception of my voice. My problem is the few times we have successfully connected, a few minutes into the conversation it drops the call and then I cannot get it to connect to him again no matter how many times I try to reconnect. It's so frustrating. I usually cannot get it to ring through to him again until the next day - and then again only once and only for about 10 minutes before it drops the call and won't reconnect.

Too Expensive: - in this day and age when there are apps for calling for free and clearly, there simply is no justification for such high prices for calls.2. Despite length of time using rebtel, you would think there would be special loyalty discounts to those of us who have used their services for such extended periods. In this day and age where every business is finding ways of rewarding customer loyalty and offering all sorts, it seems all Rebtel is about, is people using its services and loyalty does not factor into the equation. Why then should anyone want to continue with such an organization if benefits are one-sided!!        ",3 stars: Average
2332,/reviews/56e2819f0000ff000944a19f,My provieder in Belgium charged me for my calls to South Africa made via REBTEL,"            My provider in Belgium (Telenet) have charged me for all the calls I have made via 2  deals to South AfricaI purchased via REBTEL.  Calls which should have cost me ‚Ç¨23,80 have now been charged to me for the amount of ‚Ç¨361,10. My provider have rejected my request for investigation that the calls were made via a REBTEL contact number as on the REBTEL  site. I have subsequently mailed Rebtel and am waiting for an answer.   I cannot believe this has happened and have requested they pay my provider (refund me) for the costs incurred.  Just getting my money back that I have paid via credit card to REBTEL is not an option as the purchase was made in good faith so that I could call cheaply to South Africa.   I hope there is a procedure for REBTEL  to take their full responsibility for this problem as they have reputable reviews which I checked at length before signing up for their service.  I advise that REBTEL remove deals from their website to avoid other people becoming victims of the same fate as it is for a reason we use REBTEL. NOT to be charged by our providers. January I used REBTEL via a contact number in Brussels to contact South Africa and my provider did not charge me.  February they charged me for every call made.  I sent 2 mails to REBTEL support last night with  proof of my bill from my provider clearly stating the number I called was the number given on the site as a the contact number for the country I was calling which was +27 87 550 23 47;  and will have to wait the 48 hours it will take to get an answer. I hope REBTEL contact my provider to sort this out as there is nowhere I can find a telephone number for customer service as everything has to be done by mail.  I hope and trust REBTEL will  solve this as it a very unpleasant experience. I have always had good response from Patricia at customer service.  In the meantime do not make any calls using a REBTEL contact number in your destination country.  Your provider will charge you full price.  Now is the time for me and for all of us  to really rate REBTEL on their customer service and solving this problem.   It is when things go wrong that the reviews really count.  I will keep everyone posted on progress in this matter.        ",1 star: Bad

2345,/reviews/56dc9f8a0000ff000942cff2,"Good, cheap, uninterrupted network and good service","            Hi there,I had been using the Vonage service from United States to call my people in Asia-India and elsewhere, Australia or Dubai, Malaysia and Singapore though it was little expensive(every month charge will be fixed, 40-50$).However, I was disconnected from the network and I was looking for a cheap method to call India , from my cell phone itself. I had been seeing Rebtel ads but, I was initially apprehensive to use a new and unknown network and also was concerned about the reliability, money transactions etc. But, once I set up my account with the phone number, I found the ease of using it-U can set up local numbers for the international numbers you want to contact and also, dial in from the app whenever necessary, if u want to call any new no that is not stored.So, this is the first advantage. Secondly, they have quite a wide range of plans-depending on fixed and variable talk times. Also, the cost of using it is much reduced(for me, more than 3 times lesser) than the usual methods. If you use any other carrier /network like AT&T, I see their costs are always lil higher-about 5-10$ more for unlimited calls/mins.So, this way, these are the 2 main reasons, I would continue to use Rebtel for international calling, after my current 2 months usage.Also, I had an account registered on an earlier number which is not in service now. I was charged for the 2nd month cycle but, basically it was my mistake not to have deleted the account since, I forgot the pin. Later, one support representative has been kind enough to at least help me with deleting or not charging me for my old account. Only one thing, since, this company works out of Luxembourg, they delay a lil by a day or 2 while responding to ur customer service mails. But, they at least reply and are prompt in doing and trying to solve any issues.One more point is this service is available in UK, Dubai, Africa and other variety of places. They can may be expand their horizon.Good job. Happy customer...till now..!!! Congrats..and continue this way..Thanks        ",5 stars: Excellent

I even wrote an excellent review in the past concerning quality and great customer service compared to other services. The price has been an issue from the beginning until the recent outrageous hike made me update my review. Calling Ethiopia went from average 19 cents(US) up to 27 cents per minute. That is a difference of 8 cents per minute!! I was using a deal that allowed me to talk for 50 minutes with approximately $10. Now, $10 allows you to talk only for 34 minutes and that is 27 cents per minute. I have been sticking around after their price changes in the past ( partly due to the ""deals"") and the problem I had with my mobile carrier third party application issue but this time, I am leaving for good! A price hike like this is not acceptable and I will be posting this on social media so that other Ethiopians stop using this service. I know many people who are doing that already, thanks to free internet calls and more internet coverage to Ethiopia. Why should we pay this much in 2016? Bye Rebtel!

Whoever decided on the upside down logo must have seen tis coming because everything about Rebtel is upside down. Now I am searching for an alternative after being a loyal customer for years. Can't add a new number until I delete an old one and when I select one to delete, it gives me my 50 or so numbers to choose from without a name next to it...like I am supposed to remember everyone's number. I then went back into the local numbers directory to see whose number I could delete to free up space only to find out the numbers have been wrongly allocated. Now Paul's number is showing up under Steve's name and Steve's number is now someone else's. My goodness, you couldn't make up the upside down LOGO. Perfect for the new crap called Rebtel.I then try to delete one of my old phone numbers assigned to the Rebtel account. Shows me 3 numbers. I try to delete phone number 3 and see that 2 was deleted. I then selected to delete phone 2 and saw it ask for confirmation if I wanted to delete phone 3. Oh Lord!!!I have also read a lot of reviews and it is just so annoying when they reply asking you to send them a private message on facebook. C'mon!! Get a regular email. Why assume everyone must have a facebook profil? I have been off facebook for 5 years so I guess there is no way for me to contact Rebtel. The image I have of Rebtel is that of a small company that's finally been exposed. You should never have changed the look and feel of the site. Ruined it all.        ",1 star: Bad

2538,/reviews/56b741ab0000ff0009387f91,From fantastic to worse to worst,"            In my opinion, Rebtel is an excellent example, how a great idea and innovation becomes a true disaster. I was probably one of the first international users of Rebtel and registered my numbers in 3 different countries. I found it fantastic and recommended it to many of my friends. As a result I received several credits and enjoyed sort of free calling for a while - until, suddenly, the credits got an expiration date! It's like taking an award away, but also taking my motivation away to recommend it to more friends. And while I don't really care, when Rebtel changes it's lovable logo to an aggressive red and upside down logo for no reason, I do care, when one of the most practical services - to use SMS - is taken away. This is not only absolutely ridiculous, but also unacceptable to change the rules for a service, that people might have signed up for, just to use the option of sending SMS, because it is (besides email) the best way to communicate with people in very different time zones.Some more bad news: When I tried to change some of my current ""local numbers"", they were DELETED, which also meant in some cases, that I lost these numbers completely. But when I tried to add those again, that I still had in my contacts with corrected info, the system tells me, that I ran out of local numbers and cannot add any additional ones.And don't you wonder, why there is not even a link on their webpages to contact any customer service? In the beginnings of Rebtel I was even in touch with one of their founders, Jonas Lindroth, now everybody is hiding in anonymity. I guess, their is a reason for that ...Maybe someone answers at least here to the following question: As I will not use Rebtel anymore, as soon as I cannot send SMS, how do I get my money back, that is currently on my 3 accounts (US, Europe, SouthEast-Asia)?P.S. I totally agree with all the other reviewers here, specifically with Raul Perez. The ""new"" Rebtel is a total disaster.        ",1 star: Bad

What happened with you Rebtel!! I've been using your services for almost 6 years now and if you don't change I'm going to switch to another company. The main reason why I was with you guys was because you guys had the option to call somebody free by returning the call, now you are like any other company and even worst because your app is full of inconsistencies, bugs and it lacks of options, so it really doens't make any sense for me to keep using your services. Just in case you guys read this review the main things I can complain about is:1st and the most annoying, there's no place anywhere in the website or app where to contact customer service, my wife has a problem connecting and it just says ""something went wrong (what? who knows!) Please try again later or contact us (where?) if the problem persists"".2nd You guys are claiming that we can call for free to other people using the app without using wifi or internet but when I turn off wifi or mobile internet and I try to make a call to another person that has the app it says ""no internet connection to make this call"", so you are basically liars here.3rd. I sent a complain about the problems that I'm experiencing to the old support email that I have from you guys (I'm lucky I could find it in my old emails) and I just got an email saying that you guys received the complaint and I will be contacted as soon as possible, but 5 days have passed and I haven't had any luck by getting a response ticket number (#821300) in case you are interested. 4th. Your app is horrible now and your new look is horrible as well.and a list of the other complains so far: Where can I find the free call phone for each of my contacts?How can I know if the call I made or I received was a free call or a normal call?How can I see in the list of calls if it was an incoming call or outgoing one?I can't save my preferences after I click the button save, it says that my preferences were saved but I see the same options I had before. How can I change the number of a contact, it only let me change the name now?I'm thinking in going with other company as soon as I run out of credits seriously if you guys don't go back to the previous version you guys had before. It seems like Rebtel has a new owner or whatever but the new owner just doesn't know how to run the business.

I used 'phone cards until I realised their published rates only applied for the first 4 minutes of each call--then rates sky-rocket! It is very sneaky, this detail is in the small print. You may think you are paying, say, 9p/minute but you are likely to be paying 20-30p/minute.So I was delighted to find Rebtel, which did not engage in this underhand practice. With no card number to enter, Rebtel was easier to use and the ability to allocate a UK number to frequently called overseas numbers was brilliant. With Rebtel calling abroad whilst driving became easy.After a few months of being very happy with Rebtel (call quality is generally better than calling cards too), I noticed the cost of calls to Zambia had suddenly tripled! No notification, nothing. Needless to say, I no longer use Rebtel.Rebtel is a very good service but check the rates charged and keep checking--don't get caught out as I did.        ",3 stars: Average

2689,/reviews/566dc2670000ff000924495b,Worst audio quality. Use of illegal international call termination via internet and GSM Boxes,"            Here is why I don't think Rebtel is using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation exclusively for terminating calls in Ethiopia. Two Scenarios1. Rebtel Call From USA to Ethiopia (terminated using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation)    * Call is good quality    * Phone in Ethiopia show caller Id of my USA number2. Rebtel Call From USA to Ethiopia (terminated NOT using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation)    * Call is bad quality(might even drop)    * Phone in Ethiopia show caller Id of local Ethiopian Mobile Number as if its a local callI believe this second scenario happens because call is terminated using internet so bypassing Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation and generating a local call using local Ethiopian Mobile Number to the destination number. Sometimes I even hear the exact unique 'your account is low' message (not the Rebtel message) used by  Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation as if I am calling from Ethiopian Mobile phone with low account.  The people I call in Ethiopia are confused to get a call from local Ethiopian Mobile number but talk to me (from USA).  My point is this second scenario does not happen if all Rebtel calls are terminated using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation.The first thing I check when I place a call using Rebtel is ask the person I call if the number they get a call from is from my USA phone or local phone number. If it is my USA number, then great. If not and the caller Id is the local Ethiopian number, I am redialing again, because its bad quality and no use to continue with that call. I am clear that Rebtel uses different provider to route call. That is not the issue. The issue here is, which ever provider you choose should terminate calls using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation.You have been giving me general answers and not addressing the issue (Scenario 2). Rebtel Calls are being terminated illegally in Ethiopia. But I am glad you recognize ""Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation"" is the only legal telecom provider in Ethiopia. Second Step is to weed out the providers that don't terminate calls using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation.Thank you        ",1 star: Bad

If you find such a behavior, Rebtel should cancel the subscription by asking the evidence not by terminating the account.. Many people bought the subscription in recent days and got terminated, how come there will be abnormal usage. And Rebtel is advertising like true unlimited, why so if not able to provide maximum usage.. Also many people had the credits in their account that also gone.. When we contact them , no proper answer for 2-3 days and finally giving default answer.. If you want to provide default answer then why are u waiting to reply after 2 days, u might have sent some auto reply with default message.. Full of disappointments.. Kindly do something to solve all of our problem by modifying the terms and conditions with limited usage, not saying unlimited..

However, my phone broke and I got a new phone, same phone number. I forgot my login and i got new login and i lost all of my account money .. it is $0. I sent 2 emails from my phone and i just sent another email while searching using my computer and that makes me mad because I said good things about them and referred my friend to join them!  No reply? I hope I post this out they will response, if not... maybe you should be aware and think twice before you put money into Rebtel.Finally got a response from them. here is what they said....Quote:-The credit on your account expires 12 months from the last account activity (SMS or call) so as long as you SMS or call at least once a year, your balance will always carry over.This is clearly written in our Website in Legal/Terms of serviceUnquote*************************************Well.. I didn't read the terms in detail but I guess I will never ever use Rebtel again.  I don't think this is a good practice. Even I didn't use for a year, still I put the money into your company.  Lucky I found out there are many phone apps now that enable you to talk on the phone overseas like ""Line"" is good to use it as phone talking. I love WeChat for text messaging, Line's phone quality is better but you can try both. The video & talk not very smooth I guess depends on both connection.Goodbye Rebtel.

2795,/reviews/560be7880000ff00090ce964,Mixed Experience,"            I have been Rebtel customer for long time. It is more than 3 years I have been a regular customer of Rebtel. Before last week I always had a good experience about their quality of service, both technical service and customer service. I have recommended rebtel to my family members and friends in the past.Recently I had a bad experience.The support was poor for the first time. I recently changed my phone number. Therefore, I requested to transfer my money from old number to new number. There was  partial money from reference bonus. Ms.  Laura was customer agent from Rebtel end. She said that bonus credit is not transferable. It was absolutely fine if that is the Rebtel policy. I did not know Rebtel policy. So, I made my request and as a customer agent her job was to explain me nicely what can be done or cannot be done based on Rebtel Policy. However, in stead of nicely explaining me, she started to blame me that I am abusing and misusing. The terms ""abuse"" and ""misuse"" were very insulting and objectionable, especially when it was baseless and with an old customer.  It was very unprofessional behavior of Ms. Laura from Rebtel end. Then she threatened me to block my account in future.  Her whole message was rude, non-sense and unprofessional. I expressed my dissatisfaction about her rude language in response email. She never asked apology for this rude behavior.In the past I had opportunity to communicate with Ms. Cintia and Ms. Alexandra,who are very nice and professional but Ms. Laura was unlike them from Rebtel. It was a bad experience.   It gave me the feelings that Rebtel does not care their customers.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank You so much for the reply. I feel much better to see your reply. I am not sure about the facebook page. So, i am replying here. The case number was Request #709001. Just to clarify once again, I have no complain about not transferring the bonus credit. I did not know Rebtel's policy about bonus credit.  I HAVE complain because she behaved rude with me by using terms ""abuse"", ""misuse"" and by saying ""she would block my account in future.""  That was an unacceptable treatment to a customer of more than 3 years old and who regularly use Rebtel by paying money every month.  The complain is about her behavior.Thank You once again.... :)        ",3 stars: Average

Please add more credit.""day 1) Raised a support ticketday 2) Support came back asking me to give an example.day 3) I gave them all the details that rebtel wanted.day 4) No responseday 5) Asked for a response again.day 5) Rebtel support responded (within 48 hours). Created a local number for the example I mentioned an day 3. Wait a minute, I gave a example as support asked. Nothing is working. Not the example alone. Icing on the top was, the local number they gave, did not work again. Same message, credit more money. They also told me that as a policy they will respond within 48 hours.on Day (5), I Responded to rebtel that their ""Local access number"" itself is not working.

I bought the Nigeria big saver plan. Even though I may have credit on the saver plan I cannot make calls.  When I try to make call, the message I get is that I have no more credit. The last time this happened I bought additional credit but Still, I could not make a call.  This is very frustrating. The customer service is horrible, the worst of any company I have ever dealt with.  First of all there is no customer service telephone number where you can speak to an actual person. The only option is to leave a message.  When you get a response, it is to tell you that they will respond within 48 hours.  I should therefore wait until 48 hours to make a telephone call that could very well be an emergency?. I WILL GIVE THEM ZERO STARS.  They do not even deserve one star. How can a telephone company not have a telephone number for their customers to call.  I will never recommend Rebtel to any one. I will never use their service again until there is a customer service that actually works like a good company's.  THIS IS CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ITS WORST.Re: Response from RebtelI am not satisfied with your response. Why don't you have a customer service number that your customer can call for help?. A company that cares for its customer will be more sensitive to their concerns. You only confirmed what I said in my review that as a customer I cannot speak directly to a customer support staff who can help resolve a problem immediately. The only way to reach your customer support staff is through Email and the response can take up to 48 hours.

This is a very big marketing mistake for them! Rebtel is a telecom. company, and should not in any way involves the religious belief of customers in their marketing strategy. Rebtel SHOULD NOT spy on my contact lists! I am looking to replace Rebtel with something else due to these facts:- Bridge of my privacy and categorizing me as a 6-cylinder Muslim while I have no religious affiliation.- The quality is very very BAD for the first time connections. You have to re-call to get a better quality. In this way, they can charge more minutes! - I am not sure if they sell consumers data to NSA etc etc! What if I go under the surveillance of NSA etc etc because you Rebtel guys put me in practicing Muslim lists. If Rebtel does not provide any satisfactory explanation for me, I will definitely go after them both legally and on the net. I warn everyone about these serious issues.------This is my response to Rebtel team's response:------------------ Dear Rebtel Team,Religion is a very sensitive issue! PLEASE DO NOT use it for marketing purposes! You should be aware that in those countries, there are a large group of minorities who are suffering from religious related discrimination and violations!Let me give you an example to make the case clear if it is hard for you to understand my point: - Your job is to connect people in the best way! Not to congratulate the birth day of Muhammed, Moses or Jesus, based on the stereotypes! What about sending an email to Neo-Nazis congratulating Hitler's birthday, and having some Holocaust survivors in the that mailing list, too! Are you guys sending a Merry Christmas message to Christian minorities in these Islamic countries. Of course not!In short, you guys should not be identifying your diverse body of customers based on their religions!!! That is like labeling people! In all of those countries you named there are tens of non-Islamic religions. I might have called some of those countries that you named but this is my business and NOT YOUR business to track my calling list and put me in your ""Muslim Box""! What if I call India another day: Am I a Hindu or Buddhist or Muslim or Christian or ...?!!! That is ridiculous! This is exactly what NSA programs are doing! Checking who is calling whom and how long and then label them! And they will be very pleased to know that you guys have reduced their work load with your religion boxes with the names of costumers!! Being at any points of the world, does not give you any immunity from NSA or other agencies! Are suggesting you guys have a better security than Google and Yahoo and Apple ;) By the way, are 100% of people in Sweden Christian and love Jesus and go to Church!? Of course not!

My story is below:_____________I (used to) buy between 2400 - 3000 minutes per month from Rebtel. So to say that I'm a loyal customer is an understatement. I typically buy the MaxSaver deals. This month Rebtel randomly locked my account. I contacted them right away and they did not respond for 3 days. The MaxSaver deals only last for 14 days. Hence I was unable to use my minutes for those 3 days (roughly 22% of the time given). I have ALWAYS exhausted the minutes in my MaxSaver deals. So this month I lost 285 minutes because they shut off my account. Rebtel refused to extend the deal but instead gave me 20 minutes as ""compensation"" for my inconvenience. I have an international startup and it was disrupted because of Rebtel. AND their solution: 20 minutes. I contacted customer service and their response was: _____________Thanks for contacting us!i totally understand your request but as stated before its not possible for me to extend the period of your deal since the deal no longer shows on your account.Every deal that expire, disappear totally from the users account.Best Regards,MartialCustomer Team____________Rebtel SHUT DOWN MY ACCOUNT for no reason so I wasn't able to use my minutes and then refused to either extend the deal for the 3 days they made the mistake, nor would they give me my minutes back.

We usually end our conversations more frustrated than anything because it's extremely annoying to have to repeat yourself over and over again.

I'm not sure how the system selects on what phone number to assign an SMS icon, most of the time the icon does not appear next to the contact that was added, and an e-mail to the customer service has to be sent, and their reply which will take days to say ""we have received your e-mail"" and then another days to say, it has been fixed.

Are you kidding me Rebtel???The phone service is acceptable considering, occasionally a network problem which can happen with all VIP phones; however whenever I added minutes almost all the time, I won't see my added minutes or balance for another 10-20 minutes, and that is a time I can't afford to lose, since most calls are made overseas and there are time zone concerns and etc...so timing is very important to me, which I never got from Rebtel till the end.

3468,/reviews/511b73b700006400023943a7,wow!,"            It's so nice to get a number in Amsterdam for each person I want to call abroad. I can use my landline for that with unlimited calls to landlines in the Netherlands. I can also use my mobile with 800 minutes for landllines and mobile lines in the Netherlands for that. I don't have to be online after I have purchased credit for my Rebtel account. The fees for several countries are great. India is cheaper than ever. I used to have ‚Ç¨0,015 as the smallest fee and several times I paid ‚Ç¨0,02 to ‚Ç¨0,03/minute. Now only ‚Ç¨0,008 and only when the line is answered. Ghana and Mali have competetive prices. They can't still be cheap as ‚Ç¨0,07 would be. But they are just below ‚Ç¨0,15 and that's quite a standard price for other cheap ways of calling those countries. Rebtel has managed to keep their prices a little below that price of ‚Ç¨0,15 which I consider a great accomplishment.Uganda and Kenya and even Pakistan are relatively cheap at ‚Ç¨0,07 app. Very happy about that.Sending an sms must be done on the website. However you can type fast as you can use a normal keyboard which isn't possible on a handy. Sms's are cheap. I would have to pay ‚Ç¨0,55 for sending an sms to India with my mobile phone provider. Now with Rebtel it costs ‚Ç¨0,02. I also get to see when the sms is delivered. Great! I can see exactly how long it took for the sms to be delivered. I can also allow the other person to call me back or sms me back at my cost. Best of all: I don't have to pay incase the other person doesn't answer the phone. Incase I would use a cheap service number (0900 numbers) in the Netherlands for which I can call India for ‚Ç¨0,02 I would still have to pay for the 1 minute and 25 seconds I was trying to reach him. That is rounded to 2 minutes so it would cost me ‚Ç¨0,04 in total. If I would do that multiples times (as I have done at times) I am still spending a lot of money.On the downside: I can't let somebody call me back or sms me back for free incase they don't have a working internet connection on their mobile phone. They might not have a subscription for internet or their bundle might have finished or they might not have purchased internet as they might not have enough money for that. In all of these cases they can't just simply call me back at my cost. That's different with a Collect Call. An operator will ask permission and will connect the other person to me at my cost. It is expensive of course but it works. Now however people can only respond incase they can access the internet. It would have been nice if the system recognizes that I have used Rebtel for sending the sms or for calling them so that the system automatically will deduct the collect call fees for a call or sms of my Rebtel account.Keep going!

However, in a recent experience, I called someone, they didn't answer, but then they called back using the Rebtel numbers, and unknowingly I somehow ""accepted"" a collect call. Because I believed the rate to be 1.5 cents per minute, I talked for 30 minutes, only to find my account charged for close to $9. Apparently a small noise made at the beginning of my call was supposed to alert me that I was getting charged at this absurdly high rate. I think it's abusive of Rebtel to believe anyone could figure that out. I promptly went into my settings and changed my alert for receiving collect calls - I suggest all other users do the same. But I am now much more hesitant to use Rebtel due to fear of other hidden charges.        ",3 stars: Average

That beats any other provider, also no 0844 or 0870 numbers to call, where the connection charges are 14.0p, plus poor quality service.With this you pay a fixed rate and can call from your mobile or landline, where ever you are. Also you can assign local numbers such as 020, 0121, 0114 etc numbers, so when you call that number the call gets directed to the international number, saving you lots of money.I'm very happy with the service and will continue to use this unless someone else comes along and offers rates around 0.01p, which I very much doubt for now.

On my recent call to Japan, I was able to hear my mother on the other end, but she did not hear me at all, so she hung up - 7 cents for this. Both of us could hear each other on the 2nd call. Then my phone lost battery, so the call was terminated, and I called again. Same as the 1st call - my mother did not hear me - another 7 cents for nothing. I called back and it worked okay for a while, but my balance was getting low, so I added funds ($10) during the call. Guess what? The call was ended by Rebtel when the balance dropped to $10.03. Yes, there were beeps and notifications, and also automated operator was asking me to add funds. I already added funds online, so I did not add more funds on the phone. I switched from Google Voice due to the fact I had to close my Google accout. Rebtel calls worked better at the same rate of 2 cents a minute as Google Voice, before the rate went up to 7 cents.

It gives great quality during calls, sms possibility. The company also gives a local phone number I could call which redirects my calls (after authentication) to that direction I set up before. Not to mention Rebtel prizes are really cheap for some direction what I use on regular basis. I could imagine cheaper prizes for some direction (e.g.: Hungary), adding friend to contact list on PC seems not always works perfectly, missing video call option in case you want to use PC-PC call, no possibility to follow up my balance during the call (calling from PC application), what could be really annoying in case I would be close to my limit.Rebtel website also should make some reorganisation on main page, before joining it was really hard to find calling rates, but that should be on focus every time to find it easy. It is really positive they show how many minutes you could get by $10, but would be great to see even my available balance how much minutes worth to different directions.All in one: I recommend them, I'm happy to be their customer but would be happy to see some  more improvement from Rebtel.

I needed sth cheap to stay in touch with my friends and family in Poland. However I found out the hard way that rebtel  fees and rates are not as clear as company want us to believe in. For example when you top up credit they charge extra tax to it. So for example a 20‚Ç¨ credit actually costs you 23‚Ç¨. But it's not all. According to the rebtel website a single minute to polish mobile phone should cost me 0,119‚Ç¨ but after a brief chat with my sister ( around 4 min) 1,5‚Ç¨ disappeared from my account.

4104,/reviews/4e53869e00006400020d3fbb,Rebtel user in Malta - works great!,"            I moved recently to Malta and the money I spend on talking on a phone has increased. I happen to be a person who wants to talk with the family and friends back in Scandinavia when I feel like speaking to them, without planning a Skype date. The con with this is the high usage off pre paid to pup cards.. My friend suggested me to try out Rebtel. I love it! I can call more often abroad without higher cost than doing local calls. My user experience has been generally very good and I can recommend it to the people who want to stay in touch with people living in another country. Thank you Rebtel!!        ",4 stars: Great
4105,/reviews/4e537d2800006400020d3f26,Rebtel is doing great everywhere,"            I decided to try Rebtel service mainly to see if it could help those friends and relatives who are non-techie, and it did. Some phone services have hi-fi methods/plans which may be tough to implement by the common man.But Rebtel is simple, cheap and seems to be way better than conventional calling methods. Here the phone bell rings immediately as you dial the number, unlike other phone services which I have tried in this past. Though they charge a minimal price, yet the Call quality has been excellent so far.After I got accustomed to this service and was satisfied about the same, I encouraged my loved ones to register with Rebtel. My family in abroad has been using this since a year and even my relatives and friends who are dispersed across the globe. All of them are thankful to me for recommending Rebtel.The company offers you very reasonable international calls rates to various locations by assigning specific local phone numbers to your calls recipients in their countries. Rebtel also offers you the benefit of several freebies. You can call your friend and ask him to hang up for some time, and call you back while you stay on the line. You'll be connected and you get the ‚Äòfree‚Äô call advantage of the international part. It may sound weird but trust me it works.Also, you get a trial 5-minutes phone call to any number and not to forget all calls between Rebtel members are free. However, to enjoy this freebie, your friend may not necessary be a Rebtel subscriber at all but both of you must be living in one of the 51 Rebtel countries.        ",5 stars: Excellent
4106,/reviews/4e0b395600006400020b4454,Thats Why I Love Using Rebtel,"            For the next 36 months, my wife has been transferred to Manchester, UK. We have 2 kids, our son who is 8 years old and elder daughter who is 12 years old. Both the kids are very responsible and manage their activities on their own. We have tried several cheap international calling facilities, but none of them had good voice clarity, and surprisingly none of them turned out to be cheap as promised.Our neighbours recommended Rebtel. They had a lot to say about Rebtel and its cheap international calling plans. They were quite convincing and we too tried Rebtel. As a starter we got 5 minutes of free calling and since it was Easter week the call rates were further low than their normal rates. Our kids love this service and believe me the voice clarity is very good. Not to forget, Rebtel to Rebtel calling is free, so most of the times we are actually speaking free, unless we have to call some other number. Recently I got an e-newsletter from Rebtel, they serve more than 51 countries and every week they have some special offer.Its good to know how technology can help you save money. Thank you Rebtel.Pros - Cheap Rates, Good Service, Great Voice ClarityCons - Call drops on few occasions.        ",4 stars: Great

My contact list is programmed into my phone andeach one has a unique phone number, and it‚Äôs great to ask the other person to call. This serviceisn‚Äôt expensive and the rates are way better than calling cards. The quality of each call brings asmile to me.Initially Rebtel sounded a little strange to request the other party to call back but later on itbecame a routine. It‚Äôs so cool! I make a call to someone and he says shall I call you back? Iwould suggest, if it‚Äôs going to be short calls then don‚Äôt ask for a call back, since the rates are wayaffordable.Let me not forget to mention about quality, since I am frequent international caller I tried severalcalling card which used to charge me a heavy price. Not only that, even the quality of the eachcall was way bad and the wait time for the ring was too long. The service would cause painrather than comfort. I used to get cut off so often that would disturb my business conversation.With Rebtel the call quality is crystal clear and it starts ringing right away.So if you want to save your money and make life easy, Go for Rebtel!Good: Ease to execute and great call qualityBad: None        ",5 stars: Excellent
4108,/reviews/4dccf6a8000064000209d989,Easy to use and cheap,"            I use Rebtel to call two of my best friends who lives in Rio and Oslo. I use the Android app, and it's so easy to use you almost can't believe it. When you dial an international number you get a question if you want to use Rebtel, you click yes, and the call is forwarded through Rebtel, that's it!I was a bit hesitant to switch from Skype to Rebtel since the service looks a bit complicated on the home page. But I'm really happy that I decided to use Rebtel instead. I call from my own cell phone and pay almost nothing.I think Rebtel would get a lot more customers if people really understood how easy the service is to use.        ",4 stars: Great
4109,/reviews/4dc3ca01000064000209ac2b,International calls at cost of local calls,"            I'm a single mother from Newyork and currently my son is doing research in South Africa. The cost of international calls is too high, because of which we barely spoke once in 10 days.Few months back one of my son's colleagues suggested Rebtel to make cheap international calls. My son explained to me the concept of Rebtel which is based on internet telephony and why the calls made using Rebtel are cheap. Both of us have local Rebtel numbers on which we make a call, which gets internationally connected and that's how we speak to each other, every third day. And it is super easy to use. I don't have to worry about the bill s I can make payment through my credit card.I would sincerely recommend their customer support for guiding me through the entire process. Since my son is always busy on field, I take help from Rebtel customer support. The support system is apt and easily understandable by someone like me who is not technology friendly. I have even suggested Rebtel to my sister living in downtown Chicago.I just have one suggestion, please post me newsletters or other offers since I don't use the internet often.Thank you Rebtel !!

I use it a lot to talk to my friends in Germany. Sure, there are other ways that might be cheaper/free but the ease of use and the quality totaly make up for the small fee I have to pay. //P        ",4 stars: Great
